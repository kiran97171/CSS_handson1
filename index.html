   <h3> What is CSS?</h3>
   <div class="c1">
   <ol>
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper,or in other media.</li>
    <li><span id="i1">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="c5">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <li><span class="c2">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
   </ol>
   </div>
   <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
   <div class="c3">
   <ul>
    <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
    <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS files. However, <span class="c5">in this<br> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>becouse this is easier to demonstrate, and easier<br> for you to try it yourself.</li>   
</ul>
</div>
<p class="c4">When comparing CSS class vs Id, thr difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, om the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also<br>special in that you can ues a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
<p class="c4">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web papg. Once an element has been targeted, astyle or set of style or set of style can be applied to the<br> element.</p>
<p class="c4">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly uesd are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
